smop -- matlab to python compiler

Installation from sources with pip
==================================

This is the preferred option, because pip takes
care of everything -- finding the dowinload
site, installing the dependences (numpy and
networkx), etc.  If you don't have pip, this
is the perfect time to install it.

    $ pip install smop --user
    $ tar zxvf smop.tar.gz
    $ cd smop
    $ pip install . --user

If you use the --user option, don't forget to
put your .local/bin into the search path (unix only).
